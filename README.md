Some Git helper tools.

* ``githelper`` is useful mostly for working with nested copies of git-svn working copies. It has its own [documentation page](http://liyanage.github.io/git-tools/)
* ``git-checkout-by-date.sh`` lets you do exactly that
* ``git-working-copy-check.py`` performs some sanity checks on git working copies, recursively if requested
* ``template/hooks`` contains git hooks, for example a ``prepare-commit-msg`` hook to prepare merge commit messages
